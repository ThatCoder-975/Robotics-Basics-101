                <h2>Applications of Robotics in the Real World</h2>
                <h3>Security and Military</h3>
                <p>One of the applications that robotics has in the real world  is security. This application can be useful as Robots could protect humans without the risk of getting injured like a human. Robot security eliminates the need to use humans as your defense as they could obviously get hurt. One common "robotic" security feature is the doorbell camera. Instead of having someone, like a watchman, record all of the incidents, and smart detecting doorbell camera can record it all.Robots have many applications in the military. They can be used as strike forces or military medical aids without the risk of injury. Sometimes, the life of a human is just too valuable to lose because of conflicts between humans. Instead of sending human troops and strike forces, which need food, water, and are subject to human error, robots can do this on just power and have much higher accuracy in the task at hand.</p>
                <h3>Space and Underwater Exploration</h3>
                <p>The real life application of Robotics in space exploration is revolutionary as it can open up many more opportinities for future human expansion into space. Robot space explorers can also perform tasks more accurately, as with most robots, and don't need to risk the lives of humans. Robots are also great options for places where people can't reach like the deep sea, and robots are already being used for this cause! Being remote controlled, they are able to withstand immense pressure, all without the risk of injury from a human. Robots are also devoid of human error and have a much higher accuracy at what they do.</p>
                <h3>Agriculture (Farming) and Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>Agriculture is the basis of human survival, so why not use robots to spped it up? Instead of tiring out with monotonous work such as seeding, watering, and harvesting like a human, Robots can do these efficiently. Very soon, robots can be used to farm foods much faster than a human and even a machine. Speaking of monotonous work, there are many repetitive tasks in the Manufacturing and the application of robots can reduce downtime and increase productivity tremendously. This application of robotics is the most widely used today.</p>
